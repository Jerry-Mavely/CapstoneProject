Now i want a matching algorithm to match the patient and doctors based on the cultural, specialization and language metrics. However, few things to keep in mind.

1. I want a machine learning algorithm

2. The weightage of the metrics needs to be learned from the data. I dont want something where random weights are assigned and the doctors are recommended.

3. some validation criteria should also be there to check whether the recommendations are correct.

4. few approaches i can think of are a) Collaborative filtering, b) CSM, c) psm. Give the code for these as well as any approach you think is suitable for the problem


okay few things to make clear here:

1. in the encounter data: the maximum repeated encounters between a pair of patient and provider is 2. most of the patient and provider pair have 1 encounter between them.





I have a data science project in Health care domain where i have to match/recommend doctors to patients based on cultural metric like language, ethnicity, race, location and specialization.  I have uploaded a csv which contains samples from each dataset i have on each sheet viz. Patient_df, encounter_df, hospital_df and provider_df. the columns in datasets are:

patient: patient_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, gender, race, ethnicity, primary_language, zip_code, insurance_type, household_income, education_level, age, cultural_background, preferred_provider_language, cultural_preferences
encounter: encounter_id, patient_id, provider_id, encounter_date, encounter_type, primary_diagnosis, length_of_stay, total_cost, cultural_background, primary_language, languages_spoken, cultural_competency_rating, cultural_match_score, language_match, patient_satisfaction, treatment_adherence, return_visit_30_days
hospital: hospital_id, hospital_name, hospital_type, zip_code, bed_count, teaching_hospital, trauma_center, language_services_available, cultural_competency_program, interpreter_services_24_7, community_health_programs, overall_rating, patient_safety_rating, readmission_rate
provider: provider_id, npi_number, first_name, last_name, specialty, practice_zip_code, years_experience, medical_school_country, board_certified, languages_spoken, interpreter_services, cultural_certifications, minority_health_experience, community_involvement, patient_satisfaction_score, communication_rating, cultural_competency_rating, hospital_affiliation, accepts_new_patients, provider_race, provider_ethnicity

2. The weightage of the metrics needs to be learned from the data. I dont want something where random weights are assigned and the doctors are recommended.

3. some validation criteria should also be there to check whether the recommendations are correct. with training and testing sections 

4. few approaches i can think of are a) Collaborative filtering, b) CSM, c) psm. Give the code for these as well as any approach you think is suitable for the problem
5.  in the encounter data: the maximum repeated encounters between a pair of patient and provider is 2. most of the patient and provider pair have 1 encounter between them.
