Now i want a matching algorithm to match the patient and doctors based on the cultural, specialization and language metrics. However, few things to keep in mind.

1. I want a machine learning algorithm

2. The weightage of the metrics needs to be learned from the data. I dont want something where random weights are assigned and the doctors are recommended.

3. some validation criteria should also be there to check whether the recommendations are correct.

4. few approaches i can think of are a) Collaborative filtering, b) CSM, c) psm. Give the code for these as well as any approach you think is suitable for the problem
